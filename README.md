VGenes enables multimodal analysis of BCR repertoire data along with their transcriptome expression, surface protein expression, and antigen probe binding, by taking advantage of novel multimodal single-cell sequencing technics. By developing a graphical user interface (GUI), VGenes highly reduces the learning cost and allows users to efficiently and conveniently manage, analyze, edit their BCR sequences. In addition, VGenes seamlessly connects BCR sequences with antibody cloning and characterization, integrates a comprehensive collection of BCR-specific functions, aiming to help users better understand B cell repertoire and efficiently select candidates of neutralizing antibody from massive B cell populations. The use of VGenes will significantly facilitate B cell research and antibody candidate selection.
